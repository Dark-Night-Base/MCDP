# MCDP

MCDP Can Download Plugins

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è MCDP does NOT support python2 and MCDaemon! Currently only supports 
[MCDReforged](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged). 

‚ö†Ô∏è MCDP does NOT support plugins with folders, 
but these whose folders have the same name with the plugin, 
such as `hello.py` with folder `hello/`, are supported.

## How to use

Install Gitpython first: 

```Linux
pip3 install python-git
```

Then put `MCDP.py` in `plugins/`, others can be done inside the game

- `!!MCDP`: Show help message
- `!!MCDP list`: List the plugins
- `!!MCDP install [plugin]`: Install or upgrade plugin
- `!!MCDP remove [plugin]`: Remove the plugin
- `!!MCDP update`: Update list of available plugins
- `!!MCDP upgrade`: Upgrade the installed plugins

## How it works

*MCDP* manages your plugins via *git*. That's it.

## How to contribute

Click [here](https://github.com/Dark-Night-Base/MCDP/compare) to raise a pull request!

Remember: you'd better to merge into branch [dev](https://github.com/Dark-Night-Base/MCDP/tree/dev) if your plugin has not been fully tested yet.

üí°Ô∏è We encourage write configurations inside the `MCDReforged/config/` 
instead of making another config file for a single plugin.
